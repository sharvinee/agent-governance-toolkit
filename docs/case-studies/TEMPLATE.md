- AGT solution deployed with specific components (e.g., "Ed25519 cryptographic identity," "sub-millisecond policy enforcement," "Merkle-chained audit trails")
- 3-4 quantified outcomes across business impact, compliance posture, and technical performance (e.g., "87% faster processing," "zero audit findings in 12 months," "99.9% uptime with <0.1ms governance overhead")

---

## 2. Industry Context and Challenge

### 2.1 Business Problem

Include:
- Operational pain and broken process description
- Quantified business impact:
  - Processing delays (time metrics)
  - Labor costs (dollar amounts, FTE hours)
  - Error rates (percentage or absolute numbers)
  - Customer/employee impact (satisfaction scores, turnover rates)
  - Competitive disadvantage (market position, revenue loss)
- Triggering event (audit finding, regulatory deadline, volume spike, competitive threat)

### 2.2 Regulatory and Compliance Landscape

Include:
- Specific regulations with citations (e.g., "HIPAA §164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D)," "SOX Section 404")
- Compliance requirements in business terms (e.g., "Every access to patient PHI must be logged with unique user identity, timestamp, patient identifier, and documented business justification—no exceptions, with audit trails retained for 7 years")
- Compliance gaps before AGT (e.g., "No tamper-proof audit trail for AI actions," "Couldn't demonstrate minimum necessary access enforcement")
- Financial/legal exposure:
  - Civil penalties ($X to $Y per incident)
  - Criminal liability conditions
  - Calculated exposure scenarios (e.g., "An agent inappropriately accessing 1,000 patient records could trigger $50M in regulatory exposure plus reputational damage")

### 2.3 The Governance Gap

Include:
- Initial agent framework (LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, Microsoft Agent Framework, or other—specify version)
- What worked initially
- Discovered technical limitations (e.g., "LangChain 0.3 provided no mechanism to enforce that Agent A could query but not approve transactions. All agents ran as the same service account, making individual accountability impossible")
- Regulatory implications (e.g., "Without cryptographic agent identity and capability-based access control, the organization couldn't satisfy HIPAA entity authentication requirements (§164.312(d)) or SOX segregation of duties mandates")

---

## 3. Agent Architecture and Roles

### 3.1 Agent Personas and Capabilities

For each agent, include:
- Agent name and DID (`did:agentmesh:[agent-id]:[fingerprint]`)
- Trust score/tier (0-1000 score and Untrusted/Probationary/Standard/Trusted/Verified Partner tier)
  - Justification (track record duration, accuracy metrics, compliance history)
- Privilege ring (Ring 0-3)
- Primary responsibility and business process supported
- Allowed capabilities (specific actions like "Call external payer APIs via HL7 FHIR R4," "Read patient eligibility data")
- Denied capabilities (explicit restrictions like "Cannot write to EHR," "Cannot approve authorizations >$25K")
- Escalation triggers (conditions for human/higher-trust delegation like "Payer API failures exceed 3 retries," "Coverage status returns ambiguous codes," "Patient flagged as pediatric")
- Note: Agent OS enforces capability boundaries at <0.1ms latency per action

### 3.2 System Architecture Overview

[Include architecture diagram (PNG, JPEG, ASCII, or Mermaid) showing: External systems → AGT governance layer (Agent OS, AgentMesh, Agent Runtime) → Individual agents with ring labels → Audit/observability layer. Keep diagram clean with 6-8 boxes maximum.]

Explain AGT component usage and integration:
- **Agent OS**: How policies are defined and enforced (e.g., "YAML policies stored in version-controlled Git repository, evaluated in real-time at <0.1ms latency before every agent action")
- **AgentMesh**: How identity and trust are managed (e.g., "Ed25519 keypairs with mutual TLS for inter-agent communication, trust scores dynamically adjusted based on approval accuracy and policy compliance history")
- **Agent Runtime**: How agents are executed and sandboxed (e.g., "Each agent runs in dedicated Azure Container Instances with cgroup-enforced resource limits based on privilege ring")
- **Agent Compliance**: How compliance is demonstrated (e.g., "Merkle-chained append-only audit logs capturing every PHI access with millisecond timestamps, streamed to Azure Monitor write-once storage")
- **Integration points**: How this connects to existing enterprise systems (e.g., "Integrates with Epic EHR via HL7 FHIR R4 API with OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow" or "Connects to trading platform via FIX 5.0 protocol with Ed25519 message signing")

### 3.3 Inter-Agent Communication and Governance

Describe 2-3 key communication patterns. For each pattern, include:
- The flow (which agents communicate, in what sequence)
- Governance controls applied (IATP trust attestations, capability delegation with monotonic narrowing, policy enforcement at each hop)
- Concrete example (e.g., "When triage-agent delegates to insurance-verification-agent, an IATP cryptographic trust attestation is signed and verified. The downstream agent inherits the minimum of both agents' trust scores (trust score monotonic narrowing), preventing a lower-trust agent from leveraging a higher-trust agent to bypass privilege restrictions. Agent OS enforces that delegated capabilities cannot exceed the parent agent's grants—a Ring 2 agent cannot delegate Ring 1 privileges")

## 4. Governance Policies Applied

### 4.1 OWASP ASI Risk Coverage

| OWASP Risk | Description | AGT Controls Applied |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **ASI-01: Agent Goal Hijacking** | Attackers manipulate agent objectives via indirect prompt injection or poisoned inputs | Agent OS policy engine intercepts all actions before execution; unauthorized goal changes blocked in <0.1ms. Policy modes: strict (deny by default), audit (log violations). |
| **ASI-02: Tool Misuse & Exploitation** | Agent's authorized tools are abused in unintended ways (e.g., data exfiltration via read operations) | Capability-based security model; tools explicitly allowlisted per agent. Input sanitization detects command injection patterns. MCP security gateway validates tool definitions. |
| **ASI-03: Identity & Privilege Abuse** | Agents escalate privileges by abusing identities or inheriting excessive credentials | Ed25519 cryptographic identity per agent; trust scoring (0-1000) with dynamic adjustment; delegation chains enforce monotonic capability narrowing. |
| **ASI-04: Agentic Supply Chain Vulnerabilities** | Vulnerabilities in third-party tools, plugins, agent registries, or runtime dependencies | AI-BOM (AI Bill of Materials) tracks model provenance, dataset lineage, weights versioning with cryptographic signing. SBOM for software dependencies. |
| **ASI-05: Unexpected Code Execution** | Agents trigger remote code execution through tools, interpreters, or APIs | Agent Runtime execution rings (0-3) with resource limits; kill switch for instant termination; saga orchestration for automatic rollback. |
| **ASI-06: Memory & Context Poisoning** | Persistent memory or long-running context is poisoned with malicious instructions | Agent OS VFS (virtual filesystem) with read-only policy enforcement; CMVK (Cross-Model Verification Kernel) detects poisoned context; prompt injection detection. |
| **ASI-07: Insecure Inter-Agent Communication** | Agents collaborate without adequate authentication, confidentiality, or validation | IATP (Inter-Agent Trust Protocol) with mutual authentication; encrypted channels; trust score verification at connection time. |
| **ASI-08: Cascading Failures** | Initial error or compromise triggers multi-step compound failures across chained agents | Agent SRE circuit breakers; SLO enforcement with error budgets; cascading failure detection; OpenTelemetry distributed tracing. |
| **ASI-09: Human-Agent Trust Exploitation** | Attackers leverage misplaced user trust in agents' autonomy to authorize dangerous actions | Approval workflows for high-risk actions; risk assessment (critical/high/medium/low); quorum logic; approval expiration tracking. |
| **ASI-10: Rogue Agents** | Agents operating outside defined scope by configuration drift, reprogramming, or emergent misbehavior | Ring isolation prevents privilege escalation; kill switch; behavioral monitoring with trust decay; Merkle audit trails detect tampering; Shapley-value fault attribution. |

Additional security measures: mTLS for inter-agent communication, secrets management (Azure Key Vault), network segmentation (Azure Private Link).

### 4.2 Key Governance Policies

For each policy (e.g., PHI Minimum Necessary Access Control, High-Value Transaction Escalation, Vulnerable Population Protection, Rogue Agent Detection, Trust Delegation), include:
- **Regulatory driver**: Specific regulation with citation (e.g., "HIPAA §164.514(d)(3)")
- **Business risk**: What happens without this policy (with dollar amounts if applicable)
- **Technical implementation**:
  - How AGT enforces it (e.g., "Ring 2 agents denied `read:phi_clinical` capability")
  - When policy is evaluated (e.g., "Before every data access action")
  - Typical latency (usually <0.1ms)
- **Governance in Action** example:
  - Timeframe (e.g., "Week 3 of production")
  - Actor details (e.g., "documentation-agent (Ring 2, score 650)")
  - Attempted action
  - Outcome (how AGT blocked it, logging details, denial reason)
  - Penalty avoided (e.g., "$50K HIPAA penalty per incident")

### 4.3 Compliance Alignment

For each regulation, include:
- Specific regulation with citation (e.g., "HIPAA §164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D) — Information System Activity Review")
- What the regulation mandates in business terms
- AGT implementation:
  - Which component (Agent OS, AgentMesh, Agent Runtime, or Agent Compliance)
  - How requirement is satisfied (e.g., "Merkle-chained audit trails capturing every agent action with agent DID, timestamp, action type, resource accessed, and policy decision (allow/deny)")
  - Retention period
  - Storage location (e.g., "Azure Monitor write-once storage with 7-year retention")
- Audit evidence (e.g., "Big 4 audit validated 100% audit trail coverage with zero log tampering incidents across 12-month production period")

**Governance Reporting**:
- Cadence (quarterly, monthly, annual)
- Format (PDF, dashboard, API)
- Content (policy compliance rates, audit coverage metrics, trust score distributions, OWASP ASI risk posture)
- Recipients (Chief Compliance Officer, external auditor, regulatory bodies upon request)
