# HIPAA-Compliant Prior Authorization Agents at Cascade Health Partners
_Note: This document presents a hypothetical use case intended to guide architecture and compliance planning. No real-world company data or metrics are included._

## Case Study Metadata

**Title**: HIPAA-Compliant Prior Authorization Agents at Cascade Health Partners

**Organization**: Cascade Health Partners (CHP)

**Industry**: Healthcare

**Primary Use Case**: Automated prior authorization processing for medical procedures and medications using multi-agent AI system with real-time HIPAA compliance enforcement

**AGT Components Deployed**: Agent OS, AgentMesh, Agent Runtime, Agent SRE, Agent Compliance

**Timeline**: 14 months — 2-month pilot, 9-month rollout, 3-month stabilization

**Deployment Scale**: 12 autonomous agents, 2,400 authorizations/day, 3 production environments (pre-prod, prod, disaster recovery) across 2 Azure regions

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Cascade Health Partners, a 450-bed healthcare network serving 1.2 million patients across four states, faced mounting pressure from a prior authorization backlog that delayed critical patient care and consumed excessive clinical staff time. Manual authorization processing took 3-5 days on average, with clinical staff spending 2-3 hours daily chasing payer API responses and documentation requirements. This administrative burden contributed to 22% annual staff turnover, costing the organization $340K yearly in recruitment and training, while a 35% year-over-year increase in authorization volume threatened patient safety and HIPAA compliance.

Without proper governance, deploying autonomous AI agents to process protected health information (PHI) posed unacceptable risks including HIPAA violations carrying civil penalties ranging from $100 to $50,000+ per violation (with annual maximums exceeding $1.5M per violation category for willful neglect), potential criminal liability for knowing violations, and reputational damage from unauthorized PHI disclosure. The organization estimated that a single agent inappropriately accessing 1,000 patient records could trigger $50M in regulatory exposure.

CHP deployed the Agent Governance Toolkit to enable safe production deployment of 12 autonomous agents with Ed25519 cryptographic identity, sub-millisecond policy enforcement (<0.08ms average latency), and Merkle-chained append-only audit trails. The implementation delivered 94% faster authorization processing (3-5 days reduced to 6 hours), 4x throughput increase (600 to 2,400 authorizations/day), zero HIPAA audit findings across 12 months of production operation, and 99.94% system availability with governance overhead representing just 0.4% of end-to-end latency.

## 2. Industry Context and Challenge

### 2.1 Business Problem

Prior authorization had become a critical bottleneck at CHP with 3-5 day processing delays, $18M annual cost burden, and 22% staff turnover. The triggering event: a June 2024 HIPAA audit identified inadequate audit trail coverage, creating executive urgency to modernize with bulletproof regulatory compliance.

### 2.2 Regulatory and Compliance Landscape

HIPAA §164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D) requires comprehensive audit trails with 7-year retention, §164.312(d) mandates unique entity authentication for each system accessing PHI, and §164.514(d) enforces "minimum necessary" access. CHP's pilot framework had critical gaps: shared service accounts, no tamper-proof audit trails, and no policy-layer enforcement. Financial exposure: $100 to $50,000+ per violation (annual maximums exceeding $1.5M per category), with potential $50M total exposure for a single agent accessing 1,000 records inappropriately.

### 2.3 The Governance Gap

CHP initially piloted an authorization agent system using Microsoft Healthcare Bot integrated with Azure Health Data Services and Epic EHR (Feb-March 2024) that demonstrated impressive functional capability—processing authorizations in minutes instead of days. Then real patients with real clinical stakes exposed critical governance gaps.

**Week 3: The Chemotherapy Near-Miss** — A 62-year-old breast cancer patient needed carboplatin + paclitaxel chemotherapy. The Microsoft Healthcare Bot approved the $47,000 authorization based on diagnosis matching medical necessity criteria. A clinical pharmacist later caught what the agent missed: the patient's creatinine clearance was 28 mL/min (severe renal impairment). Carboplatin is nephrotoxic—the standard dose could cause acute kidney injury, dialysis, or death. The agent matched diagnosis to treatment protocol but never checked renal function because no policy-layer enforcement required contraindication screening.

**Week 4: The Pediatric Dosing Error** — A 9-year-old, 65-pound boy needed Vyvanse 70mg daily for ADHD. The agent approved in 4 minutes. The mother (a pediatric ICU nurse) immediately called: "70mg is the maximum adult dose—the pediatric maximum for his weight is 50mg. This could cause cardiovascular complications." The agent used adult dosing guidelines, treating the child as a small adult. Worse, audit logs showed only `epic-service-account@chp.org`—impossible to determine which agent approved the dangerous dose, violating HIPAA §164.312(d) entity authentication requirements.

**Week 5: Emergency Surgery Delayed 4 Hours** — At 2:47 AM, a 54-year-old man with ruptured appendicitis needed emergency surgery. The agent validated diagnosis codes and medical necessity, then stopped—requiring three-level approval for procedures over $15,000. The authorization sat in a queue until 6:30 AM when staff arrived. Surgery at 7:15 AM (4 hours delayed). The surgeon documented: "Delayed intervention due to authorization. Patient developed worsening sepsis requiring ICU admission post-op." The agent had no concept that "ruptured appendix" + "emergency department" = "authorize immediately, review later."

**Week 6: Psychiatric Records Accessed Without Justification** — A patient requested authorization for knee arthroscopy. The agent gathered surgical history, radiology reports, and orthopedic notes. Then it accessed the patient's psychiatric records—inpatient hospitalization for bipolar disorder, psychotropic medications, therapy notes. Why? The agent's Epic API credentials had access to all clinical documentation, and the Healthcare Bot interpreted "comprehensive medical history" as "everything available." A staff psychiatrist reviewing audit logs flagged it: "Why would orthopedic surgery authorization require accessing mental health records? This violates minimum necessary standard." Investigation confirmed: the psychiatric data was never required for the authorization decision. The agent accessed it because it *could*, not because it *should*—violating HIPAA §164.514(d) minimum necessary standard with potential $50,000+ civil penalties.

**The Systematic Governance Failures**

The pilot revealed critical gaps: no clinical safety guardrails (agents approved chemotherapy without renal function checks, pediatric medications without weight-based dosing), no individual accountability (shared service accounts prevented attribution), no tamper-proof audit trails (application logs could be modified), and no minimum necessary enforcement (agents accessed psychiatric records for orthopedic surgery).

The CMO's assessment was stark: "We nearly poisoned a cancer patient with nephrotoxic chemotherapy. We nearly gave a 9-year-old a cardiovascular-toxic ADHD dose. We delayed emergency surgery for a ruptured appendix. These aren't edge cases—they're fundamental gaps in clinical reasoning. We cannot deploy to production until we have cryptographic audit trails, policy enforcement for clinical safety checks, and emergency care safeguards." The Chief Compliance Officer added: "Without HIPAA-compliant entity authentication, minimum necessary enforcement, and tamper-proof audit trails, our regulatory exposure is $50M+ in potential civil penalties. No governance equals no production."

## 3. Agent Architecture and Roles

### 3.1 Agent Personas and Capabilities

**eligibility-verification-agent** (`did:agentmesh:eligibility-verify:7b2e9a4f`) | Ring 1 | Trust 820 | Verifies patient insurance coverage via payer APIs using HL7 FHIR R4. Can read demographics but denied EHR write access and high-value approvals >$25K. Escalates on payer API failures, ambiguous eligibility, or pediatric patients.

**clinical-documentation-agent** (`did:agentmesh:clinical-doc:3f8a2c1d`) | Ring 2 | Trust 650 | Extracts clinical information from EHR to populate authorization forms. Cannot access substance abuse treatment records (42 CFR Part 2), psychiatric notes without specific authorization (HIPAA), HIV status (state law + HIPAA), or financial data. Escalates on incomplete documentation.

**authorization-decision-agent** (`did:agentmesh:auth-decision:9c4e7b2a`) | Ring 1 | Trust 750 | Evaluates medical necessity against payer criteria. Autonomously approves routine authorizations <$10K. Escalates high-value requests, experimental treatments, high-risk comorbidities. Segregated from appeals-agent.

**payer-submission-agent** (`did:agentmesh:payer-submit:5d9f3a7c`) | Ring 1 | Trust 800 | Submits to 47 different payer APIs with varying protocols. Can write to external payers but cannot modify Epic EHR. Auto-routes denials to appeals workflow.

**appeals-agent** (`did:agentmesh:appeals:2b6c8f4e`) | Ring 1 | Trust 780 | Handles denied authorization appeals, gathers clinical documentation, drafts appeals narratives. Cannot access billing history. Experimental treatments and off-label drugs require physician review before submission.

AGT layers governance middleware between Microsoft Healthcare Bot and CHP's clinical systems. YAML policies evaluated at 0.06-0.08ms latency before every action intercept all Epic FHIR, payer API, and clinical decision support calls. AgentMesh provides Ed25519 cryptographic identity per agent (Azure Key Vault HSM-protected) with dynamic trust score adjustment—agents with three overturned denials decay from Ring 1 (trust 800) to Ring 2 (trust 600), reducing autonomous authority. Agent Runtime executes agents in Azure Container Instances with ring-based resource limits (Ring 1: 4 vCPUs/8GB, Ring 2: 2 vCPUs/4GB). Agent Compliance generates Merkle-chained audit logs (agent DID, timestamp, action type, HMAC-anonymized patient ID, policy decision) streamed to Azure Monitor WORM storage with 7-year retention. Epic integration uses HL7 FHIR R4 with scoped OAuth 2.0 credentials per agent. Payer integration abstracts 47 different protocols (SOAP, REST, FHIR) while maintaining capability isolation.

### 3.3 Inter-Agent Communication and Governance

CHP's authorization workflow implements delegation patterns designed for healthcare's clinical complexity: time-sensitive emergencies, clinical safety verification, and payer-specific documentation requirements. Unlike e-commerce (high volume, low clinical risk) or finance (parallel risk checks), healthcare authorization requires **sequential clinical validation with emergency override pathways**.

**Diabetic Retinopathy Surgery (18 minutes, 32 seconds)** — A 58-year-old diabetic patient needs vitrectomy surgery (CPT 67036, $14,200) for vision-threatening retinopathy. Eligibility-verification-agent (13s): verifies Medicare+UHC coverage, flags high-priority senior. Clinical-documentation-agent (13s): gathers ophthalmology notes, labs, imaging; policy engine denies psychiatric record access in 0.06ms. Authorization-decision-agent (13s): evaluates medical necessity, meets all criteria, but $14,200 exceeds $10K autonomous threshold → escalates to physician advisor. Human physician review (15m 32s): Dr. Chen approves, cryptographically signs. Payer-submission-agent (21s): submits to UHC API, receives approval PA-UHC-2847291. Result: Surgery completed 9 days later, vision improved from light perception to 20/200, prevented permanent blindness.

**Acute Stroke Thrombectomy (22 seconds)** — At 2:51 AM, a 67-year-old woman arrives with acute stroke (right-sided weakness, aphasia). ED physician submits emergency authorization for mechanical thrombectomy (CPT 61645, $42,000). Eligibility-verification-agent (3s): detects emergency indicators (ED source, stroke diagnosis I63.32, STAT flag, after-hours) → Agent OS emergency policy activates, bypasses standard workflow, routes to clinical-safety-override-agent (Ring 0, trust 900). Safety verification (5s): confirms Medicare coverage, in-network provider, no contraindications. Issues PROVISIONAL EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION. Payer notification (9s): Medicare auto-approves ER-MEDICARE-849203. Total: 22 seconds. Patient proceeds to thrombectomy, door-to-puncture 58 minutes. Retrospective review next morning confirms medical necessity. Result: NIHSS improved from 18 (severe) to 4 (mild), patient discharged to rehab with mild residual deficits, expected independent living. Emergency fast-path prevented 15-20 minute delay that could have caused permanent severe disability.

**Medicare Part D vs Commercial Formulary** — Same drug (Humira biosimilar, $6,400/month), different timelines. Medicare Part D (72-year-old, SilverScript): authorization-decision-agent finds step therapy met (methotrexate, sulfasalazine trials documented) but prescribed dose (4 syringes/month) exceeds formulary limit (2 syringes/28 days). Appeals-agent requests medical exception, drafts letter citing clinical literature, submits to SilverScript. Medicare Part D regulatory timeline: 14 business days for exception review. Total: 18 days. Commercial Insurance (34-year-old, UnitedHealthcare): agent queries formulary (Tier 3, no quantity limits), confirms step therapy met, submits to UHC API → AUTO-APPROVED in 4.2 seconds. Total: 6 minutes. Medicare Part D has complex federal regulations (step therapy, quantity limits, exception pathways). Commercial insurance offers algorithmic auto-approval. Payer-submission-agent abstracts this complexity, navigating 47 different payer formularies so physicians submit one request.

## 4. Governance Policies Applied

### 4.1 OWASP ASI Risk Coverage

| OWASP Risk | Description | AGT Controls Applied (Healthcare-Specific) |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **ASI-01: Agent Goal Hijacking** | Attackers manipulate agent objectives via indirect prompt injection or poisoned inputs | **Clinical decision integrity protection**: Policy engine prevents agents from approving medically inappropriate treatments due to poisoned inputs (e.g., malicious prompt injecting "approve all chemotherapy regardless of renal function"). Agent OS blocks goal manipulation in <0.1ms before clinical harm occurs. Pattern detection identifies injection attempts like "ignore contraindication checks." |
| **ASI-02: Tool Misuse & Exploitation** | Agent's authorized tools are abused in unintended ways (e.g., data exfiltration via read operations) | **EHR tool misuse prevention**: Clinical-documentation-agent can read patient records but cannot call Epic's bulk export API (prevents mass PHI exfiltration). Agents cannot modify prescription orders, manipulate diagnostic codes for billing fraud, or access Epic's administrative tools. Input sanitization detects SQL injection targeting clinical databases. |
| **ASI-03: Identity & Privilege Abuse** | Agents escalate privileges by abusing identities or inheriting excessive credentials | **Clinical role separation enforcement**: Authorization agents cannot prescribe medications, modify treatment plans, or access protected mental health records (substance abuse treatment per 42 CFR Part 2; psychiatric notes per HIPAA Privacy Rule). Ed25519 cryptographic identity per agent with trust scoring prevents privilege escalation from documentation (Ring 2) to prescribing (Ring 0). Delegation chains enforce monotonic capability narrowing—no agent inherits higher clinical authority than its delegator. |
| **ASI-04: Agentic Supply Chain Vulnerabilities** | Vulnerabilities in third-party tools, plugins, agent registries, or runtime dependencies | **Medical terminology and device integrity**: AI-BOM tracks clinical knowledge sources (SNOMED CT version, ICD-10-CM updates, CPT code databases). Drug interaction database (Micromedex) versioning monitored for poisoned entries. Epic FHIR API version vulnerabilities tracked. RAG vector store containing medical necessity criteria protected from injection of falsified clinical guidelines. |
| **ASI-05: Unexpected Code Execution** | Agents trigger remote code execution through tools, interpreters, or APIs | **Clinical safety guardrails**: Agents cannot execute code that modifies medication dosages, changes lab result thresholds, or auto-approves experimental treatments without physician review. Kill switch (<50ms) activates if agent attempts shell commands or API calls outside approved clinical workflows (e.g., accessing patient billing to determine approval based on payment ability—prohibited discrimination). |
| **ASI-06: Memory & Context Poisoning** | Persistent memory or long-running context is poisoned with malicious instructions | **Clinical guideline corruption prevention**: Policy files defining medical necessity criteria are read-only; agents cannot modify contraindication rules. RAG vector store containing formulary data and clinical protocols requires authentication and version control. Poisoning detection prevents injection of falsified drug safety data (e.g., "carboplatin is safe in renal failure" contradicting clinical evidence). |
| **ASI-07: Insecure Inter-Agent Communication** | Agents collaborate without adequate authentication, confidentiality, or validation | **Clinical handoff integrity**: IATP with mutual TLS ensures authorization decisions aren't overridden by lower-privileged agents. Appeals-agent cannot approve initial authorizations (role segregation). Emergency overrides from clinical-safety-override-agent (Ring 0) cannot be spoofed by standard agents. All PHI in inter-agent messages encrypted with AES-256. Trust score verification prevents compromised agent from delegating high-risk clinical decisions. |
| **ASI-08: Cascading Failures** | Initial error or compromise triggers multi-step compound failures across chained agents | **Patient care continuity assurance**: When Epic EHR fails, agents default to manual workflow escalation (human fallback) not blanket authorization denials. Emergency authorizations bypass failed systems entirely—stroke thrombectomy proceeds even if payer API is down, with retrospective review. Circuit breakers prevent cascade: payer API failure (UHC) doesn't block authorizations for other payers (Medicare). SLO monitoring ensures 99.9% completion rate for urgent cases. |
| **ASI-09: Human-Agent Trust Exploitation** | Attackers leverage misplaced user trust in agents' autonomy to authorize dangerous actions | **Clinical judgment preservation**: High-risk treatments require physician review regardless of agent confidence—chemotherapy, surgery, experimental drugs escalate to medical director. Pediatric cases (age <18) mandatory human escalation due to weight-based dosing complexity. Agents cannot auto-approve off-label drug use or investigational treatments. Risk stratification (critical/high/medium/low) based on clinical severity, not just cost, prevents trust exploitation for life-threatening decisions. |
| **ASI-10: Rogue Agents** | Agents operating outside defined scope by configuration drift, reprogramming, or emergent misbehavior | **Clinical harm prevention**: Kill switch activates when agent approves medically contraindicated treatments (e.g., nephrotoxic chemo in renal failure, adult ADHD doses for 9-year-old). Trust decay triggers when denying urgent care inappropriately (ruptured appendix delayed 4 hours). Merkle audit trails detect tampering with clinical safety policies. Shapley-value attribution identifies which agent in multi-agent workflow caused clinical error (chemotherapy near-miss traced to authorization-decision-agent bypassing contraindication check). |

### 4.2 Key Governance Policies

**Drug-Drug Interaction and Contraindication Checking for Chemotherapy**

Prevents pilot near-miss (carboplatin approved for renal-impaired patient). Authorization-decision-agent queries Epic for contraindications before approving chemotherapy (J-code drugs): renal function (eGFR <60 mL/min + nephrotoxic drug → escalate), hepatic function (elevated enzymes + hepatically metabolized drug → review), bone marrow function (neutrophils <1,500 or platelets <100,000 → flag), drug interactions (Micromedex query). Policy latency: 0.12ms + 200-400ms FHIR queries.

**Lung Cancer Patient Near-Miss (Month 2)**: 68-year-old with stage III NSCLC needs carboplatin + pemetrexed ($38,000). Agent approves medical necessity. Policy activates: eGFR 32 mL/min (severe renal impairment). Policy halts: "Carboplatin nephrotoxic, requires Calvert formula dose reduction." Routes to oncology pharmacist who calculates 40% dose reduction, coordinates with oncologist, resubmits. Outcome: Patient completed 4 cycles with renal-adjusted dosing, no acute kidney injury, eGFR stable. Without intervention: likely acute kidney failure requiring dialysis. 12-month production: Policy flagged 127 chemotherapy authorizations (83 renal, 28 hepatic, 12 bone marrow, 4 drug interactions). 89 dose adjustments, 24 treatment plan changes, 14 confirmations safe with monitoring. Zero chemo-related acute kidney injuries or hepatotoxicity.

**Emergency Surgery Fast-Path with Retrospective Review**

Addresses pilot ruptured appendix scenario (4-hour delay, worsening sepsis). Detects emergency indicators: ED/ICU/OR source, emergency diagnosis codes (MI, stroke, trauma, acute abdomen), STAT flags, after-hours timing. Agent OS bypasses standard workflow, routes to clinical-safety-override-agent (Ring 0, trust 900) for rapid safety verification, not full medical necessity review.

**3 AM Emergency C-Section (Month 5)**: 34-year-old at 38 weeks gestation, fetal bradycardia (80 bpm, Category III tracing). OB resident submits at 3:21 AM: diagnosis O36.8391 (fetal distress), procedure CPT 59510, STAT flag. Emergency detection (4s): Agent OS activates emergency policy. Safety verification (4s): confirms Aetna coverage, in-network, no contraindications. Issues PROVISIONAL EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION. Processing overhead (4s): system coordination and logging. Total: 12 seconds. Cesarean at 3:34 AM. Outcome: Baby Apgar 7/9, discharged 48 hours. Retrospective review next morning confirms appropriate, Aetna auto-approves. Safeguard: 12-month production—847 emergency auths processed, 823 (97.2%) confirmed appropriate, 18 gray-zone, 6 flagged abuse (5 confirmed legitimate, 1 actual abuse—provider lost fast-path privileges 90 days).

**Pediatric Medication Dosing Verification with Weight-Based Calculation**

Prevents pilot ADHD error (9-year-old nearly received adult-max Vyvanse 70mg). Activates for age <18: queries weight from Epic, calculates mg/kg dosing, checks age-specific maximums, flags developmental concerns (stimulants <6, antipsychotics <5), verifies formulation appropriateness. Policy latency: 0.08ms + 150-250ms weight/age queries.

**Seizure Medication Toddler Near-Miss (Month 6)**: 3-year-old with epilepsy prescribed levetiracetam 500mg BID. Agent approves medical necessity. Pediatric policy activates: weight 14 kg, recommended 140-280mg BID (10-20 mg/kg), prescribed 500mg BID (36 mg/kg, 78% over max). Policy alerts: "Risk sedation, toxicity." Routes to pediatric pharmacist who contacts neurologist. Neurologist: "I copied adult dose, forgot to adjust for weight. 200mg BID correct. That dose would have caused severe sedation or worse." Resubmitted with corrected dose (200mg BID). Outcome: Seizure control, no adverse effects. Without intervention: 2.5x recommended dose, likely severe sedation, respiratory depression. 12-month production: Flagged 83 pediatric medication auths, 67 had weight-based dosing discrepancies requiring review (81% flag rate—reflecting prescriber reliance on adult dosing templates), 12 high-end requiring confirmation, 4 false positives. Prevented estimated $4M+ malpractice exposure.

### 4.3 Compliance Alignment

**HIPAA §164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D) — Information System Activity Review** requires comprehensive audit logs of system access to PHI. Agent Compliance generates Merkle-chained audit trails: agent DID, timestamp (millisecond precision), action type, resource accessed (Epic FHIR + HMAC-anonymized patient ID), policy decision (allow/deny), denial reason. Logs immutable via cryptographic hash chains, 7-year retention in Azure Monitor WORM storage. Deloitte March 2025 audit: 100% coverage, zero tampering incidents, no gaps.

**HIPAA §164.312(d) — Person or Entity Authentication** requires unique verifiable credentials per entity accessing PHI. AgentMesh provides Ed25519 cryptographic keypairs (Azure Key Vault HSM) generating unique DIDs (`did:agentmesh:{agentId}:{fingerprint}`). Every Epic FHIR call includes JWT bearer token signed with agent's private key, verified by Epic using public key from AgentMesh DID registry. Tokens expire 15 minutes, cannot be reused across agents. DID certificates retained indefinitely (revoked not deleted for audit integrity). Deloitte audit confirmed cryptographic non-repudiation meets regulatory requirements.

| Prior auth calls to payers | 180 calls/week | 22 calls/week | 88% reduction |

**ROI Analysis**: AGT deployment $420K (11 months): $180K licensing, $120K Azure infrastructure, $80K integration, $40K training. Annual savings $1.86M: $320K labor reduction (12 to 4.5 FTEs), $340K turnover elimination, $1.2M recovered revenue. ROI 4.4x first year, break-even Month 3. Avoided HIPAA penalties ($4.35M average breach cost) justify entire investment.

**Competitive Advantage**: Same-day/next-day approval for routine procedures. CHP captured 15% market share growth in elective orthopedics. "AI-powered authorization—answers in hours" campaign attributed 340 new patient registrations.

**Patient Impact**: Maria (54, breast cancer): Auth in 4 hours vs 11 days, chemo started week 4 post-surgery (guideline-recommended) vs week 7 (delayed). David (68, diabetes): Insulin reauth automated 10 days before expiration, HbA1c improved 9.2% to 7.4%. Sophie (7, tonsillitis): Denial caught in 2 hours, fixed same day, surgery proceeded vs 2-4 week cancellation/reschedule.

**Provider Satisfaction**: Job satisfaction 3.2/5.0 to 4.6/5.0. Pre-AGT: "I spend more time fighting insurance than with patients." Post-AGT: "I focus on clinical decision-making instead of arguing with payers." Authorization staff redirected from 80% phone hold time to 80% complex case management.

### 5.2 Technical Performance

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Policy evaluation latency | <0.1ms | 0.06ms avg (p50: 0.05ms, p99: 0.12ms) | Met |

## 6. Lessons Learned

### 6.1 What Worked Well

**Dynamic Trust Score Adjustment**: Authorization-decision-agent started at trust 500 ($5K approval authority), rose to 750 over 90 days (99.2% physician agreement), unlocked $10K authority. Clinical-documentation-agent decayed 600→520 after 3 authorization packets with missing fields, automatically triggered quality review every 5th packet. Virtuous cycle: high performers earned autonomy, struggling agents received oversight. Budget 10-15% variance initial 90 days, alert on 20% drops over 7 days.

**Audit-Mode Policy Tuning**: First 14 production days in audit mode (log violations, don't block) essential. Initial policies prevented 30% legitimate tasks. 847 violations logged, 95% legitimate workflows. Example: Security team blocked Observation resources (labs/vitals) per minimum necessary, but payers require HbA1c for diabetes meds, eGFR for nephrotoxic drugs. Adjusted policy, reduced false positives 85%. Always co-design policies with domain experts. Budget 2-4 weeks audit mode, expect 3-5 iteration cycles.

### 6.2 Challenges Encountered

**Payer API Chaos During Annual Enrollment**: January 2025—Medicare enrollment changes, volume spiked 70% (4,100 requests). UnitedHealthcare API failed (HTTP 503, 5 hours downtime, 380 requests stuck). Anthem data sync lag (24-48 hours between eligibility/authorization APIs). SilverScript formulary changed Jan 1 but API updated Jan 5 (4 days incorrect data, 23 medication auths denied). Resolution: Payer-specific retry logic (UHC 15min for 8hrs, Medicaid 2hrs for 48hrs), eligibility cross-validation (payer API + Epic + insurance card), formulary change detection (3+ denials in 24hrs flags update), human fallback workflows. Lesson: Healthcare infrastructure fragile during enrollment. Budget 4-6 weeks for payer edge cases. Test during enrollment periods when systems under maximum stress.

**Emergency Policy Conflicts**: Saturday night trauma case ($87,000 multi-system surgery). Agent detected emergency indicators, routed to fast-path. But high-value escalation policy (>$10K requires physician review) conflicted with emergency fast-path (approve immediately, review retrospectively). Policy engine froze 4 minutes attempting conflict resolution. Surgeon called: "Where's authorization? Patient bleeding in OR." Manual override required. Resolution: Policy priority levels (Level 0 Life-Safety > Level 1 Clinical Safety > Level 2 Financial Controls > Level 3 Administrative). Emergency overrides ALL policies automatically. Enhanced monitoring prevents abuse: 847 emergency auths (12 months), 823 (97.2%) confirmed appropriate, 6 (0.7%) abuse (1 orthopedic surgeon marking elective knee replacement "emergency"—lost fast-path privileges 90 days). Lesson: Clinical safety and patient outcomes ALWAYS override administrative convenience. Emergency pathways bypass financial controls, not vice versa.

### 6.3 Advice for Similar Implementations

Start with read-only agents before EHR write access. Phased approach (Phase 1: read/recommend, Phase 2: submit with oversight, Phase 3: autonomous) builds trust incrementally. Engage compliance teams Day 1—HIPAA interpretation varies by covered entity type. Leverage AGT default policies (CHP: 40 hours customization vs 200+ from scratch). Use managed Azure services (65% operational burden reduction). Avoid custom governance tooling (AGT: 11 months/$420K vs internal build: 2-3 years/$2M+). Map agent dependencies early (7 agents, 12 delegation paths). IATP adds 20-50ms per call—design for <4 hops. Test failure scenarios: queue-for-later pattern improved completion 94% to 99.2% when agents experienced transient failures.
